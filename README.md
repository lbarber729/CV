Having recently returned back to the UK after living and working abroad I was after a new career challenge. I came across Makers, a 16 week coding bootcamp in London, and thus started my journey of becoming a developer. 

My experience at Makers has taught be the fundamentals of software development through pair programming, individual projects and working in agile teams to create fun projects like [this](https://acebook-d-railed.herokuapp.com/). I am now looking for a junior developer role that, in a supportive environment, that will help to further my development.

#### Skills 

- Team player - I am always happy to find my place in a team, be it getting stuck in and getting my hand dirty, taking on more of a leadership role or being the moral booster.

- Fast Learner - I am able to pick up new technologies quickly and efficiently. For my final project at Makers in 2 weeks I was able to create a mobile app in a framework that I had no previous experience in.

- Adaptable - I have always been able to adapt to new environments easily. In my previous temporary job when they needed additional help in different departments I was able to seamlessly join new teams and learn new ways of working with no problems. 

- Initiative - I believe in working hard and there always being a way to do something better. I like to take on challenges that will push me to be better than I was yesterday. In my previous positions as a dive instructor I increased business through starting monthly club night talks, weekly club dives and free try dives where possible.
