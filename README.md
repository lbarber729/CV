Having recently returned back to the UK after living and working abroad I was after a new career challenge. I came across Makers, a 16 week coding bootcamp in London, and thus started my journey of becoming a developer. 

My experience at Makers has taught be the fundamentals of software development through pair programming, individual projects and working in agile teams to create fun projects like [this](https://acebook-d-railed.herokuapp.com/).
